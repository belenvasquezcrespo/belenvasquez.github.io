## Education						       		
- Joint M.S., Urban and Regional Planning	| University of Dortmund & University of the Philippines (_July 2023_)
- B.S., Architecture | University of Cuenca (_July 2018_)

## Work Experience
**Student Assistant @ National Center for Transportation Studies (_Jan 2023 - Present_)**
- Applied GIS spatial data mining techniques to inform transport planning decisions related to sustainable and green policies at the municipal level.
- Applied R Studio to origin and destination in urban mobility, relation of variables, and inferential statistics in transport planning projects and academic proposals.

**Director of Urban Planning, Use and Land Management @ Superintendence of Territorial Planning (_April 2021 - Sept 2021_)**
- Led online workshops with all 221 Municipalities of Ecuador to enhance their capacity in land use planning. Strengthened connections between mayors and evaluators, promoting the enforcement of laws and institutionalizing urban planning practices nationwide.
- Developed and launched IPSOT's data platform, enhancing access to critical urban analysis information (risk areas, urban growth, protected areas)

**Urban Analyst @ Superintendence of Territorial Planning (_August 2018 - March 2021_)**
- Optimized resource allocation and upheld institutional performance indicators during the COVID crisis by leveraging GIS analysis and spatial data mining techniques to effectively select urban plans for evaluation based on considerations such as land use, infrastructure, transport networks, and risk areas.
- Implemented evaluation methodologies for municipal land use plans in Ecuador, leveraging legal expertise, transparency, and analytical skills. Produced evaluation reports that identified vulnerabilities in urban plans, contributing to improved governance processes and fostering sustainable development practices.

## Projects
### Exploring Mobility of Care: Granular and Spatial Analysis in the Philippines

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Tactical Urbanism: Recover Riverfronts in Ecuador

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
