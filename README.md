## Education						       		
- Joint M.S., Urban and Regional Planning	| University of Dortmund & University of the Philippines (_July 2023_)
- B.S., Architecture | University of Cuenca (_July 2018_)

## Work Experience
**Student Assistant @ National Center for Transportation Studies (_Jan 2023 - Present_)**
- Applied GIS spatial data mining techniques to inform transport planning decisions related to sustainable and green policies at the municipal level.
- Applied R Studio to origin and destination in urban mobility, relation of variables, and inferential statistics in transport planning projects and academic proposals.

**Director of Urban Planning, Use and Land Management @ Superintendence of Territorial Planning (_April 2021 - Sept 2021_)**
- Led online workshops with all 221 Municipalities of Ecuador to enhance their capacity in land use planning. Strengthened connections between mayors and evaluators, promoting the enforcement of laws and institutionalizing urban planning practices nationwide.
- Developed and launched IPSOT's data platform, enhancing access to critical urban analysis information (risk areas, urban growth, protected areas)

**Urban Analyst @ Superintendence of Territorial Planning (_August 2018 - March 2021_)**
- Optimized resource allocation and upheld institutional performance indicators during the COVID crisis by leveraging GIS analysis and spatial data mining techniques to effectively select urban plans for evaluation based on considerations such as land use, infrastructure, transport networks, and risk areas.
- Implemented evaluation methodologies for municipal land use plans in Ecuador, leveraging legal expertise, transparency, and analytical skills. Produced evaluation reports that identified vulnerabilities in urban plans, contributing to improved governance processes and fostering sustainable development practices.

## Projects
### Exploring Mobility of Care: Granular and Spatial Analysis in the Philippines

This study investigates the significance of care activities for transportation planning and public policy in Guiuan, Philippines. By focusing on the mobility of care, the research aims to understand the impact of care-related travel patterns and sociodemographic and gender concerns on transportation planning. The study takes a proactive approach to comprehend the dynamics of Guiuan's transportation system, ensuring inclusivity and unbiased decision-making processes. Through enhanced data gathering tools and spatial analysis techniques, decision-makers gain valuable insights into spatial variations, individual characteristics of travelers, and challenges within the area.

### Tactical Urbanism: Recover Riverfronts in Ecuador

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.

### Urban Projects: Design and Visualization

The projects focus on enhancing public participation and improving urban design to meet the needs of the population. The first project is a transportation terminal that aims to create a seamless integration of various modes of transportation and provide a convenient and efficient hub for commuters. The second project is a Nursery and Care facility designed to cater to the needs of families and children, promoting a nurturing and inclusive environment. Both projects emphasize the importance of city integration and thoughtful planning in creating sustainable and functional spaces. The designs are visually presented through 3D modeling and visualization techniques, showcasing the proposed facilities in a realistic and immersive manner. These projects serve as a testament to my skills in architectural design, urban planning, and creating engaging visual representations of architectural concepts.
